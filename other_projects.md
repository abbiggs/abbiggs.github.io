### CS 222 Project

**Project Description:**  My CS 222 semester long project was a collaboration with two other students, in which we made use of Java and IntelliJ to build a Daily Horoscope desktop application.  The application made use of a free API that when given a horoscope sign and a date would return the horoscope for that day reflecting the given sign.  The application also did sign compatibility tests and was user friendly, allowing users who did not know their sign, to quickly figure out which sign they were.

**Tech Stack**:

- IntelliJ
- Java


### Misc Projects

### 1. Memory Management Unit

**Project Description:** This project simulates a memory management unit by making use of the Paging Memory Management system. It allows the user to preset the amount of frames in RAM, and create processes on demand. When a process is created, it is allocated a user given number of frames from RAM, so long as the RAM has that many frames to allocate. The system allows the user to view the state of RAM, view which processes are allocated which frames, kill processes, print out the page table of a given process, and provides address translation when given an 8 bit logical address.  When a process is killed, all frames allocated to this process are returned to RAM.

**Tech Stack**:

- IntelliJ
- Java
- Multithreaded Programming
